Callback func vs Events
***********************
    On Callback, the provided callback function is called as the request completed.
    Which means simply, one request, one reply.
    
    On Event model, it is more of a publish/subscribe approach. On funcion can be
    invoked repeatedly to provide multiple functions to invoke.

    In Callback, no result received until you received all the results.
    
    In Event model, functions associated with the item event will be invoked for each item.
    Act on the first item as soon as it arrives and the second and so forth.
